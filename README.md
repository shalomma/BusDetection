# Buses Project

Object detection project as part of Computer Vision Course 2018 TAU

## Getting Started

We used SSD (single shot detection) for our project and Inception v2 network (by google) as the base network for feature extraction.
We implemented the model using TensorFlow and its Object Detection API.
